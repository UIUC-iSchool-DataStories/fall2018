# Today

1. Review of some coding for visualization
2. Introduction of data sources and getting data in
3. Exploratory analysis
4. Data sources
5. Idyll, Observeable and Colaboratory

---

# Discussion questions

What did you think of this visualization...

1. ...from an aesthetic standpoint?
2. ...from a technical standpoint?
3. ...from a **human** standpoint?

# The Medium

The way we tell a story is often as important as the story we tell.

For instance, these two tell the same "story."

 * [Different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIcXRbZ458)

# Data Sources

Divide into groups.  Explore:

 * data.world
 * data.gov
 * data.illinois.gov
 * data.humdata.org

Prepare an introduction to between one and three datasets you identify that you
are interested in exploring.  Think about these things:

 * What format is the data in?
 * What is the type of data (rows, columns, connectivity, etc)
 * What story might be hidden?

---

# Loading Data

Next, try loading the data.  You have access to the [iSchool
Jupyterhub](https://jupyterhub.ischool.illinois.edu) and can upload your
dataset there.

---

# What can we learn about the data?

---

# Markdown

Markdown is a "plain-text"

 * To **bold**, use `**two asterisks**`
 * You can _italicize_ with `_underscores_`
 * Try out making bullet lists with `*` on each line
 * Links are fun: `[link text](http://example.com/)`

---

# Reactive Environments

Discuss: what are the principal differences in how you use and interact with Excel versus Jupyter notebooks?

---

# Idyll

 * Markdown, compiles to static [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
 * [idyll-lang.org](https://idyll-lang.org/)
 * [idyll.pub](https://idyll.pub)

---

# ObservableHQ

 * [observablehq.com](https://beta.observablehq.com/)
 * [A Better
   Way](https://medium.com/@mbostock/a-better-way-to-code-2b1d2876a3a0)

# Lab

Given one of your datasets:

 * Explore it in Jupyter or otherwise
 * Develop the structure of a story to highlight features or items of interest
 * Begin implementing in Observable, Idyll, or using Jupyter widgets.
