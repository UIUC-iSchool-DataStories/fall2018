# Today

Our discussion today will center on how we can compare the structures of a
visualization to those of storytelling.

These are our elements:

 * Context (and Meta-Context)
 * Characters
 * Setting
 * Plot

We will guide ourselves with questions.

---

## Viz and Storytelling: Context

* What is this data?
* How is it being represented?
* What is it telling me?

---

## Viz and Storytelling: Meta-Context

* What are the **characters** in our data story?
* What is the **setting** or environment of our data story?
* What is the **plot** of our data story?

---

## Data Characters

 * Confidante
 * Dynamic
 * Flat
 * Foil
 * Round
 * Static
 * Stock

(See e.g., [Ervin](http://www.fictionfactor.com/guests/common.html) )

---

## Data Characters

 * **Confidante**
 * **Dynamic**
 * Flat
 * Foil
 * **Round**
 * **Static**
 * Stock

We will think of these in terms of their **predictability** and their
**complexity**.

## Data Characters: Confidante

Revealing information through indirect information.  Patterns or information
casting "shadows" that reveal the original.

## Data Characters: Dynamic (the Wildcard!)

They're the one who changes all the time!  Minute to minute, you don't know
what you're going to get.  They're all over the place, and sometimes you can
contain their behavior, but not always!

## Data Characters: Round

Complex, many different attributes, hiding what might be rich relationships
between characteristics.

 <!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/round.svg" data-background-size="contain" --> 

---

## Data Characters: Static

You pretty much know what to expect.  Take a glance at first, get a sense of
the parameters, and you can roughly figure it out from there.

## Data Setting: Where does our story take place?

> “The most important thing in art is The Frame. For painting: literally; for
> other arts: figuratively-- because, without this humble appliance, you can't
> know where The Art stops and The Real World begins. You have to put a 'box'
> around it because otherwise, what is that (....) on the wall?”

## Data Setting: Where does our story take place?

This is the only part we really control.

---

## Data Setting: Where does our story take place?

Here, it takes place on a couple axes, it is marked by points, they don’t seem
to have colors, and the scales and intra-data relationships are defined
according to our expectations.

## Data Setting: Where does our story take place?

Now we’ve added another property to the display. Maybe we’ve  changed our
scales and annotated it with some markers.

## Data Plot: What is the data telling us?

Remember: Time is but one of our dimensions.

---

## Data Plot: What is the data telling us?

 * There's a pattern, or background story
 * Things change
 * There's something hidden in these data!

---

## Data Plot: What is the data telling us?

 * There's a pattern, or background story (Equilibrium)
 * Things change (Hero's Journey)
 * There's something hidden in these data! (Enigma)

---

## Case Study

 * What is the data's character?
 * What's the setting of the story?
 * What is the plot of this data story?
